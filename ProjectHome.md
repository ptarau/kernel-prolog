Kernel Prolog is an update of a simple open source Prolog interpreter written by Paul Tarau. It distributes various algorithms like unification and LD-resolution used in evaluation Prolog goals over a hierarchy of lightweight term classes. It uses first-class logic engines to express concisely various computations as well as interoperation with the underlying Java system. Syntax is limited to Horn Clauses + various built-ins. All predicates assume prefix notation, no operators are supported. Styla, a new Scala-based derivative of Kernel Prolog, that is significantly closer to full Prolog, is now available at: http://code.google.com/p/styla/ .
